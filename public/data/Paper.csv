They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the March 2019 series for most Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2019 © UCLES 2019 Page 2 of 9 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2019 © UCLES 2019 Page 3 of 9 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2019 © UCLES 2019 Page 4 of 9 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(a) removal from the, body / organism / cell ;

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the March 2020 series for most Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 2 of 12 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 3 of 12 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 4 of 12 5 ‘List rule’ guidance (see examples below) For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form, (e.g. a × 10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 5 of 12 mark scheme abbreviations • ;

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the March 2021 series for most Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2021 © UCLES 2021 Page 2 of 10 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2021 © UCLES 2021 Page 3 of 10 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided. • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n. • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n. • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response. • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2021 © UCLES 2021 Page 4 of 10 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a × 10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme. mark scheme abbreviations • ; separates marking points • / alternatives • R reject • A accept (for answers correctly cued by the question, or guidance for examiners) • I ignore as irrelevant • AW alternative wording (where responses vary more than usual) • AVP alternative valid point • ora or reverse argument • underline actual word given must be used by candidate (grammatical variants excepted) www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2021 © UCLES 2021 Page 5 of 10 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(a) name of gland letter in Fig. 1.1 hormone produced adrenal C adrenaline pancreas E insulin testis D testosterone ;;;

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the February/March 2022 series for most Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2022 © UCLES 2022 Page 2 of 12 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2022 © UCLES 2022 Page 3 of 12 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided. • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n. • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n. • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response. • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2022 © UCLES 2022 Page 4 of 12 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a × 10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme. Mark scheme abbreviations • ; separates marking points • / alternative responses for the same marking point • R reject the response • A accept the response • I ignore the response • ecf error carried forward • AVP any valid point • ora or reverse argument • AW alternative wording • underline actual word given must be used by candidate (grammatical variants excepted) • ( ) the word / phrase in brackets is not required but sets the context www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2022 © UCLES 2022 Page 5 of 12 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(a)(i) alveoli / alveolus ;

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the February/March 2023 series for most Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 2 of 10 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 3 of 10 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided. • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n. • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n. • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response. • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 4 of 10 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a  10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme. Mark scheme abbreviations • ; separates marking points • / alternative responses for the same marking point • R reject the response • A accept the response • I ignore the response • ecf error carried forward • AVP any valid point • ora or reverse argument • AW alternative wording • underline actual word given must be used by candidate (grammatical variants excepted) • ( ) the word / phrase in brackets is not required but sets the context www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 5 of 10 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(a)(i) B ;

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the February/March 2024 series for most Cambridge IGCSE, Cambridge International A and AS Level components, and some Cambridge O Level components. 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2024 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2024 Page 2 of 11 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alon gside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptions for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2024 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2024 Page 3 of 11 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation fro m other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided. • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n. • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n. • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response. • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2024 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2024 Page 4 of 11 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a  10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme. Mark scheme abbreviations • ; separates marking points • / alternative responses for the same marking point • R reject the response • A accept the response • I ignore the response • ecf error carried forward • AVP any valid point • ora or reverse argument • AW alternative wording • underline actual word given must be used by candidate (grammatical variants excepted) • ( ) the word / phrase in brackets is not required but sets the context 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2024 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2024 Page 5 of 11 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(a)(i) substance that increases the rate of a reaction ;

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the February/March 2025 series for most Cambridge IGCSE, Cambridge International A and AS Level components, and some Cambridge O Level components. 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2025 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2025 Page 2 of 12 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alon gside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptions for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2025 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2025 Page 3 of 12 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation fro m other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided. • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n. • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n. • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response. • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. 0610/42 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2025 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2025 Page 4 of 12 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a  10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded.

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2018 series for most Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level and Cambridge Pre-U components, and some Cambridge O Level components. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2018 © UCLES 2018 Page 2 of 10 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2018 © UCLES 2018 Page 3 of 10 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2018 © UCLES 2018 Page 4 of 10 Abbreviations used in the Mark Scheme • ;

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2019 series for most Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level and Cambridge Pre-U components, and some Cambridge O Level components. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2019 © UCLES 2019 Page 2 of 14 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2019 © UCLES 2019 Page 3 of 14 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2019 © UCLES 2019 Page 4 of 14 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(a) (group of) organisms that can reproduce ;

This mark scheme is published to support teachers and students and should be read together with the question paper. It shows the requirements of the exam. The answer column of the mark scheme shows the proposed basis on which Examiners would award marks for this exam. Where appropriate, this column also provides the most likely acceptable alternative responses expected from students. Examiners usually review the mark scheme after they have seen student responses and update the mark scheme if appropriate. In the June series, Examiners were unable to consider the acceptability of alternative responses, as there were no student responses to consider. Mark schemes should usually be read together with the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. However, because students did not sit exam papers, there is no Principal Examiner Report for Teachers for the June 2020 series. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the June 2020 series for most Cambridge IGCSE™ and Cambridge International A & AS Level components, and some Cambridge O Level components. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 2 of 13 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 3 of 13 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 4 of 13 5 ‘List rule’ guidance (see examples below) For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form, (e.g. a × 10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 5 of 13 mark scheme abbreviations • ;

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2021 series for most Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2021 © UCLES 2021 Page 2 of 13 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2021 © UCLES 2021 Page 3 of 13 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided. • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n. • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n. • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response. • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2021 © UCLES 2021 Page 4 of 13 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a × 10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2021 © UCLES 2021 Page 5 of 13 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(a)(i) prokaryote / plant ;

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2022 series for most Cambridge IGCSE, Cambridge International A and AS Level and Cambridge Pre-U components, and some Cambridge O Level components. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2022 © UCLES 2022 Page 2 of 12 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with:  the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question  the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question  the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively:  marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate  marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do  marks are not deducted for errors  marks are not deducted for omissions  answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2022 © UCLES 2022 Page 3 of 12 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …):  The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided.  Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n.  Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n.  Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response.  Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2022 © UCLES 2022 Page 4 of 12 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a  10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme.

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2023 series for most Cambridge IGCSE, Cambridge International A and AS Level and Cambridge Pre-U components, and some Cambridge O Level components. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 2 of 10 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with:  the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question  the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question  the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively:  marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate  marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do  marks are not deducted for errors  marks are not deducted for omissions  answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 3 of 10 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …):  The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided.  Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n.  Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n.  Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response.  Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 4 of 10 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a  10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme. Mark scheme abbreviations  ; separates marking points  / alternative responses for the same marking point  R reject the response  A accept the response  I ignore the response  ecf error carried forward  AVP any valid point  ora or reverse argument  AW alternative wording  underline actual word given must be used by candidate (grammatical variants excepted)  ( ) the word / phrase in brackets is not required but sets the context www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 5 of 10 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(a) K ;

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2024 series for most Cambridge IGCSE, Cambridge International A and AS Level and Cambridge Pre-U components, and some Cambridge O Level components. 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2024 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2024 Page 2 of 15 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptions for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with:  the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question  the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question  the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively:  marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate  marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do  marks are not deducted for errors  marks are not deducted for omissions  answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2024 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2024 Page 3 of 15 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …):  The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided.  Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n.  Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n.  Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response.  Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2024 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2024 Page 4 of 15 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a  10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme. Mark scheme abbreviations  ; separates marking points  / alternative responses for the same marking point  R reject the response  A accept the response  I ignore the response  ecf error carried forward  AVP any valid point  ora or reverse argument  AW alternative wording  underline actual word given must be used by candidate (grammatical variants excepted)  ( ) the word / phrase in brackets is not required but sets the context 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2024 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2024 Page 5 of 15 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(a) any two from: (fish has) fins / no legs / no limbs ;

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers.

They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme.

A long-term study of a large group of women was used to test this hypothesis. The women were between 35 and 45 years old at the start of the study. Every two years the same group of women were asked how much they were exercising. After 28 years the researchers analysed their data: • They calculated the average time spent exercising per week by each woman. • They put the women into categories determined by how much exercise they had done. • For each category, they calculated the number of women who died from coronary heart disease (CHD).

They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2019 © UCLES 2019 Page 3 of 13 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2020 series for most Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level and Cambridge Pre-U components, and some Cambridge O Level components. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 2 of 13 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 3 of 13 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided. • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n. • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n. • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response. • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 4 of 13 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a × 10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme.

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2021 series for most Cambridge IGCSE, Cambridge International A and AS Level and Cambridge Pre-U components, and some Cambridge O Level components. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2021 © UCLES 2021 Page 2 of 12 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2021 © UCLES 2021 Page 3 of 12 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided. • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n. • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n. • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response. • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2021 © UCLES 2021 Page 4 of 12 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a × 10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme. Mark scheme abbreviations • ; separates marking points • / alternative responses for the same marking point • R reject the response • A accept the response • I ignore the response • ecf error carried forward • AVP any valid point • ora or reverse argument • AW alternative wording • underline actual word given must be used by candidate (grammatical variants excepted) • ( ) the word / phrase in brackets is not required but sets the context www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2021 © UCLES 2021 Page 5 of 12 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(a)(i) reptiles and amphibians ;

GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2022 © UCLES 2022 Page 3 of 15 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided. • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n. • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n. • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response. • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2022 © UCLES 2022 Page 4 of 15 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a  10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme. Mark scheme abbreviations • ; separates marking points • / alternative responses for the same marking point • R reject the response • A accept the response • I ignore the response • ecf error carried forward • AVP any valid point • ora or reverse argument • AW alternative wording • underline actual word given must be used by candidate (grammatical variants excepted) • ( ) the word / phrase in brackets is not required but sets the context www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2022 © UCLES 2022 Page 5 of 15 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(a)(i) mechanical / physical, digestion ;

GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 3 of 12 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 4 of 12 Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided. • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n. • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n. • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response. • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 5 of 12 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a  10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme. Mark scheme abbreviations • ; separates marking points • / alternative responses for the same marking point • R reject the response • A accept the response • I ignore the response • ecf error carried forward • AVP any valid point • ora or reverse argument • AW alternative wording • underline actual word given must be used by candidate (grammatical variants excepted) • ( ) the word / phrase in brackets is not required but sets the context www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 6 of 12 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(a)(i) Y is FSH ;

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2024 series for most Cambridge IGCSE, Cambridge International A and AS Level components, and some Cambridge O Level components. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2024 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2024 Page 2 of 12 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptions for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2024 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2024 Page 3 of 12 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided. • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n. • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n. • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response. • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2024 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2024 Page 4 of 12 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a  10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme. Mark scheme abbreviations • ; separates marking points • / alternative responses for the same marking point • R reject the response • A accept the response • I ignore the response • ecf error carried forward • AVP any valid point • ora or reverse argument • AW alternative wording • underline actual word given must be used by candidate (grammatical variants excepted) • ( ) the word / phrase in brackets is not required but sets the context www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/41 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2024 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2024 Page 5 of 12 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(a)(i) L ;

Amylase is an enzyme that catalyses the break down of starch. Starch changes the colour of iodine solution from orange-brown to blue-black. Step 1 The students added 2 cm3 of starch solution to a test-tube, labelled it W, and placed it into a beaker of warm water. Step 2 They added 2 cm3 of starch solution to a second test-tube, labelled it C, and placed it into a beaker of iced water. Step 3 The students placed one dropping pipette into each of test-tubes W and C. Step 4 They waited five minutes before continuing. Step 5 The students added 10 drops of amylase solution to each of test-tubes W and C and shook both test-tubes gently. Step 6 They started a timer. Step 7 The students immediately tested the liquids in test-tubes W and C for starch using iodine solution. Step 8 The students repeated step 7 after 2, 4, 6 and 8 minutes. (a) Iodine solution can affect the activity of amylase. The students tested the liquids in test-tubes W and C using iodine solution without affecting the activity of the amylase.

They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/62 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2018 © UCLES 2018 Page 3 of 8 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/62 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2018 © UCLES 2018 Page 4 of 8 Abbreviations used in the Mark Scheme • ;

One was biological and contained enzymes and detergent. The other was non-biological and contained only detergent. They were provided with: • four pieces of dry cloth that had been stained with the same food • a solution of biological washing powder in a beaker labelled bio • a solution of non-biological washing powder in a beaker labelled non-bio • distilled water in a beaker labelled water. Step 1 A marker pen was used to divide a white tile into four sections. The four sections were labelled bio, non-bio, water and not washed. Step 2 One piece of stained dry cloth was placed on the not washed section of the white tile. Step 3 One piece of stained dry cloth was placed into each of the solutions labelled bio, non-bio and water. Step 4 One glass rod was used to push the pieces of cloth into the liquid in each beaker. The liquid in each beaker was then stirred for 10 seconds. Step 5 The liquid in each beaker was stirred again, for 10 seconds, after 5, 10 and 15 minutes. Step 6 After 15 minutes each piece of cloth was removed from the liquid and placed on the labelled area of the white tile. Step 7 The student observed the stain on each piece of cloth and used the intensity score in Table 1.1 to determine the intensity of the stain on the four pieces of cloth. A drawing of the four pieces of cloth at the end of the experiment is shown in Fig. 1.1. not washed water non-bio bio Fig. 1.1 www.dynamicpapers.com 3 0610/62/F/M/19 © UCLES 2019 [Turn over Table 1.1 intensity score lowest intensity + ++ +++ highest intensity ++++ (a) (i) Prepare a table to record the results in the space provided.

The cells of beetroot contain a coloured pigment. This pigment may leak from the cells if the cell membranes are damaged. A student investigated the effect of temperature on the leakage of pigment from beetroot cells. Step 1 Cylinders of varying length were cut from a beetroot. The student was provided with two of the beetroot cylinders. The student cut both cylinders to 3 cm in length. Step 2 The student labelled one test-tube C and another test-tube H. Step 3 The student put some cold water into test-tube C and some hot water into test-tube H. Step 4 The student measured the temperature of the water in test-tube C and in test-tube H.

Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/62 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 4 of 8 Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance (see examples below) For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/62 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 5 of 8 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form, (e.g. a × 10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme. mark scheme abbreviations • ; separates marking points • / alternatives • R reject • A accept (for answers correctly cued by the question, or guidance for examiners) • I ignore as irrelevant • AW alternative wording (where responses vary more than usual) • AVP alternative valid point • ora or reverse argument • underline actual word given must be used by candidate (grammatical variants excepted) www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/62 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 6 of 8 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(a)(i) 1 table drawn with header lines and at least 2 columns ; 2 headings with unit for temperature ; 3 recording of two correct temperatures and 2 observations that correspond with the temperatures ; 3 R units in data cells 1(a)(ii) more (pigment) is leaked at higher temperatures / AW ; ora 1 1(a)(iii) same, surface area / area of beetroot exposed to water / AW ; ora same, number of cells / amount of pigment (of tissue at start) ; ora 1 1(a)(iv) error volume (of water was not stated) / AW ; apparatus measuring cylinder / syringe / (graduated) pipette / burette ; OR error temperature would change over time ; apparatus (named) insulating material / lid ; named correct equipment matching an error from a different step in the procedure ; 2 A (thermostatically) controlled water-bath 1(a)(v) duration of shaking / AW ; intensity / AW ; 2 1(b)(i) temperature ; 1 1(b)(ii) wider range (of temperatures) ; ora repeats ; ora measured light (that passes through liquid) ; ora 2 A calculates an average / identifies anomalies ; ora A collects numerical / quantitative, data / not subjective www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/62 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 7 of 8 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(b)(iii) result that does not fit the pattern / does not fit with the other results / not concordant / AW ; 1 1(b)(iv) did not include anomaly (in the average) / AW ; 1 1(b)(v) Axes – labelled with units ; Scale – suitable scale and plotted points occupies at least half the grid ; Plots – all points plotted accurately ± half a small square ; Lines – suitable line drawn ; 4 1(b)(vi) intersection on trendline at 50°C shown ; value from graph ; 2 Question Answer Marks Guidance 2(a)(i) Outline – single clear line no shading ; Size – larger than image ; Detail ;; 4 2(a)(ii) length of PQ correctly measured with units as 67 ± 1 mm or 6.7 ± 0.1 cm ; 56 (mm) / 6 (cm) ;; 3 MP1 is a measurement mark with matching units MP2 correct manipulation of formula MP3 correct rounding to a whole number 2(b)(i) to show that the beetroot causes the effect ; 1 2(b)(ii) replace beetroot juice with (same volume of) water ; 1 A no beetroot juice 2(b)(iii) 8.5 (%) ;; 2 MP1 correct graph readings 510 (s) and 470 (s) MP2 correct calculation www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/62 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 8 of 8 Question Answer Marks Guidance 2(c) 1 at least 2 different volumes of beetroot juice ; 2 details of when juice is consumed / ref to fasting / AW ; 3 details of method to measure running time ; 4 rest breaks between repeat measurements ; 5, 6 and 7 named constant variables ;;; e.g. • concentration of beetroot juice • correct detail of consistency in running • age / stature / sex / fitness, diet, health, of athletes • same (named) environment conditions of exercise 8 many participants in each group OR repeat (whole experiment) with same individual(s) for many trials ; 9 safety precaution ; 6 2(d) add Benedict’s (solution) ; heat ; red / orange / green / yellow (if reducing sugars are present) ; 3 www.dynamicpapers.com","2025-06-22","2025-06-23","2025-06-23"

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the March 2021 series for most Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/62 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2021 © UCLES 2021 Page 2 of 7 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/62 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2021 © UCLES 2021 Page 3 of 7 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind.

The student prepared different sized blocks of agar. The blocks of agar had different surface areas. The agar contained universal indicator which made the agar green in colour. The blocks of agar were put in hydrochloric acid. Universal indicator turns red in the presence of acid. As the acid diffused into the agar block, the indicator changed from green to red in colour. The time taken for the acid to diffuse to the centre of the block was measured. Step 1 10 cm3 of 1 mol per dm3 hydrochloric acid was put into each of four test-tubes. Step 2 The student used a ruler and a knife to measure and cut four blocks of agar, A, B, C and D, from a larger piece of agar. Each block was a different size, as shown in Fig. 1.1.

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the March 2022 series for most Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/62 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2022 © UCLES 2022 Page 2 of 7 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/62 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2022 © UCLES 2022 Page 3 of 7 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided. • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n. • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n. • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response. • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/62 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED March 2022 © UCLES 2022 Page 4 of 7 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a × 10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme.

Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided. • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n. • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n. • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response. • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/62 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 4 of 7 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a  10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme.

Anaerobic respiration in yeast breaks down glucose to form ethanol and carbon dioxide. Anaerobic respiration in yeast causes the blue dye, methylene blue, to become colourless. The time taken for the blue colour to disappear can be used as a measure of the rate of anaerobic respiration in yeast. The student used this method: Step 1 Label one test-tube 0.0%, one test-tube 0.5% and one test-tube 1.0%. Step 2 Put 5.0 cm3 of water into the test-tube labelled 0.0%. Step 3 Put 2.5 cm3 of 1.0% glucose solution and 2.5 cm3 of water into the test-tube labelled 0.5%. Step 4 Put 5.0 cm3 of 1.0% glucose solution into the test-tube labelled 1.0%. Step 5 Stir the contents of the beaker containing the yeast suspension with the glass rod. Step 6 Add 5.0 cm3 of the yeast suspension to each of the test-tubes labelled 0.0%, 0.5% and 1.0%. Step 7 Put all three test-tubes into a water-bath at 40 °C. Step 8 Start the stop-clock and wait for three minutes. Step 9 After three minutes, remove the test-tubes from the water-bath and place them in a test-tube rack. Step 10 Use a pipette to add one drop of methylene blue dye to each of the test-tubes. Carefully mix the contents of each test-tube with the glass rod. Step 11 Use a second pipette to slowly add a layer of oil to each of the test-tubes. The layer of oil will float on top of the yeast suspension and methylene blue mixture, as shown in Fig. 1.1. 1.0 cm layer of oil to maintain anaerobic conditions test-tube contents Fig. 1.1 3 0610/62/F/M/24 © UCLES 2024 [Turn over Step 12 Put the test-tubes back into the water-bath and restart the stop-clock. Step 13 Measure the time taken for the blue colour in each of the test-tubes to disappear. Record the time taken in seconds for each test-tube.

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the February/March 2024 series for most Cambridge IGCSE, Cambridge International A and AS Level components, and some Cambridge O Level components. 0610/62 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2024 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2024 Page 2 of 9 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alon gside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptions for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. 0610/62 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2024 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2024 Page 3 of 9 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the February/March 2025 series for most Cambridge IGCSE, Cambridge International A and AS Level components, and some Cambridge O Level components. 0610/62 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2025 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2025 Page 2 of 9 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alon gside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptions for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. 0610/62 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2025 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2025 Page 3 of 9 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thre sholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation fro m other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided. • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n. • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n. • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response. • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. 0610/62 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2025 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2025 Page 4 of 9 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a  10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme. Mark scheme abbreviations • ; separates marking points • / alternative responses for the same marking point • R reject the response • A accept the response • I ignore the response • ecf error carried forward • AVP any valid point • ora or reverse argument • AW alternative wording • underline actual word given must be used by candidate (grammatical variants excepted) • ( ) the word / phrase in brackets is not required but sets the context 0610/62 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED February/March 2025 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2025 Page 5 of 9 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(a)(i) 3 and 1 ;

These proteins are used in the body to make enzymes and other cell structures. You are going to estimate the concentration of protein in two solutions, A and B, using the results from a set of standard protein solutions. Known concentrations of protein solution were made. Using biuret reagent, the colour intensity score was determined at each concentration. Step 1 Seven test-tubes were labelled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.

Some mammals produce an enzyme called rennin. Rennin changes the protein in milk so that it can be digested by another enzyme. The action of rennin causes small lumps or clots to form in the milk. An investigation was carried out to find the effect of pH on the activity of the enzyme rennin. Step 1 Three test-tubes were labelled P, Q and R. Step 2 A syringe was used to add 5 cm3 of milk to each of these test-tubes. Step 3 A dropping pipette was used to add two drops of acid to test-tube P. Step 4 A dropping pipette was used to add two drops of distilled water to test-tube Q. Step 5 A dropping pipette was used to add two drops of alkali to test-tube R. Step 6 Another three test-tubes were labelled P1, Q1 and R1. Step 7 A clean syringe was used to add 1 cm3 of 0.1% rennin solution to each of test-tubes P1, Q1 and R1. Step 8 All six test-tubes were placed into a water-bath at 40 °C and left for three minutes. Step 9 The contents of test-tube P1 were added to test-tube P. The contents of test-tube Q1 were added to test-tube Q. The contents of test-tube R1 were added to test-tube R. Step 10 Test-tubes P, Q and R were kept in the water-bath and a stop-clock was started. Step 11 After one minute, test-tube P was removed from the water-bath. It was tipped and rotated as shown in Fig. 1.1. The appearance of the milk was observed, and the stage of clotting was decided by comparing it to the diagrams in Fig. 1.1. stage A no clotting stage B some clotting stage C all clotted milk drains back smoothly from the sides of the test-tube small clots stick to the sides of the test-tube most of the milk is solid and does not pour when the test-tube is tipped Fig. 1.1 Step 12 Test-tube P was returned to the water-bath. Step 13 Steps 11 and 12 were repeated for test-tubes Q and R. Step 14 Steps 11, 12 and 13 were repeated every minute for five minutes. www.dynamicpapers.com 3 0610/61/M/J/18 © UCLES 2018 [Turn over The results are shown in Fig. 1.2. Test-tube P had some clotting at one minute and was all clotted at two minutes. Test-tube Q had no clotting at one, two or three minutes but some clotting at four and five minutes.

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.

They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2018 © UCLES 2018 Page 3 of 9 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2018 © UCLES 2018 Page 4 of 9 Abbreviations used in the Mark Scheme • ;

They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous.

Each test-tube was gently shaken for 3 seconds to mix the contents. Step 4 5 cm3 of Benedict’s solution was added to test-tube D which contained 10 cm3 of energy drink D. The test-tube was gently shaken for 3 seconds to mix the contents. Step 5 Hot water was put into a beaker that was used as a water-bath. Step 6 The temperature of the hot water in the water-bath (initial temperature) was measured. Step 7 Test-tube A was put into the water-bath and a stop-clock was started. Step 8 Test-tube A was observed and the stop-clock was stopped when the contents of the test-tube first changed colour. Step 9 Test-tube A was removed from the water-bath. Step 10 Steps 7, 8 and 9 were repeated with test-tubes B, C and D.

This mark scheme is published to support teachers and students and should be read together with the question paper. It shows the requirements of the exam. The answer column of the mark scheme shows the proposed basis on which Examiners would award marks for this exam. Where appropriate, this column also provides the most likely acceptable alternative responses expected from students. Examiners usually review the mark scheme after they have seen student responses and update the mark scheme if appropriate. In the June series, Examiners were unable to consider the acceptability of alternative responses, as there were no student responses to consider. Mark schemes should usually be read together with the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. However, because students did not sit exam papers, there is no Principal Examiner Report for Teachers for the June 2020 series. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.

They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question.

GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts.

GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 4 of 8 5 ‘List rule’ guidance (see examples below) For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form, (e.g. a × 10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 5 of 8 mark scheme abbreviations • ; separates marking points • / alternatives • R reject • A accept (for answers correctly cued by the question, or guidance for examiners) • I ignore as irrelevant • AW alternative wording (where responses vary more than usual) • AVP alternative valid point • underline actual word given must be used by candidate (grammatical variants excepted) www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 6 of 8 Question Answer Marks 1(a)(i) 5.0 ; 1 1(a)(ii) (initial temperature) 80 and (final temperature) 60 ; 1 1(a)(iii) table drawn with two columns and a header row ; column headings with unit: test-tube and time (taken for colour change) / s ; four correct times recorded in seconds (A:36, B:87, C:165, D:90) ; 3 1(a)(iv) 2(%); 1 1(a)(v) idea of comparing the time for D with A, B and C / B was the closest time to D / AW ; 1 1(b)(i) error: temperature has decreased ; improvement: maintain temperature by, using a thermostatically controlled water-bath / Bunsen burner / adding hot water throughout the investigation (and monitoring) temperature / insulate beaker / AW ; 2 1(b)(ii) times are slower as temperature decreases / unable to identify the concentration of glucose in D with certainty / may underestimate the concentration ; 1 1(c)(i) any two from: volume of glucose solution ; volume of Benedict’s solution ; concentration of Benedict’s solution ; time for mixing of test-tube contents ; 2 1(c)(ii) heating liquid (that might spill out of test-tube) / use of Benedict’s solution / AW ; 1 1(d)(i) axes correctly labelled with units: time / minutes and mass of starch remaining / g ; scale evenly spaced and occupying half of the grid in both directions ; five correct plots ± half a small square ; line joining all five plot points ; 4 1(d)(ii) mass of starch remaining decreases and levels off / AW ; 1 1(d)(iii) mass correct from candidate’s graph ; graph marked at interpolation to show where reading taken ; 2 www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 7 of 8 Question Answer Marks 1(d)(iv) (42 ÷ 5 =) 8.4 (g per minute) ; 1 1(e) method: 1&2 use of Benedict’s reagent to measure reducing sugar produced, at set time / at regular intervals ; ref. to use of hot water-bath / use of (thermostatically controlled) water-bath to maintain temperatures ; OR use of iodine solution to determine starch remaining ; ref. to drops on spotting tile at regular intervals ; independent variable: 3 ref. to using at least two different temperatures ; variables kept constant – max two from mp 4-8: 4 same type of enzyme ; 5 concentration of starch suspension ; 6 concentration of enzyme ; 7 same pH ; 8 incubating enzymes and starch suspension for same time ; dependent variable: 9 concentration of reducing sugar produced / time taken for drops and iodine solution to remain brown ; 10 ref. to at least two further replications / repeat investigation two more times ; 11 ref. to relevant safety precaution ; 6 Question Answer Marks 2(a)(i) line AB = 70 ±1 mm and line CD = 22 ±1 mm ; 1 2(a)(ii) (x)700 / 710 / 690 ; 1 2(a)(iii) 0.03 mm ;;; 3 www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 8 of 8 Question Answer Marks 2(b)(i) outline: has clear single lines without shading ; size: occupies at least half the space available ; details: correct proportions sperm and ovum ; shape of sperm – round / oval head and long tail ; ovum labelled with label line touching the ovum ; 5 2(b)(ii) any three from: ovum is larger than the sperm ; ovum is round, sperm long and thin ; ovum has rough surface, sperm is smooth ; ovum has a uniform shape, sperm is wider at one end ; 3 www.dynamicpapers.com","2025-06-22","2025-06-23","2025-06-23"

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2021 series for most Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2021 © UCLES 2021 Page 2 of 8 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2021 © UCLES 2021 Page 3 of 8 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided. • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n. • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n. • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response. • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2021 © UCLES 2021 Page 4 of 8 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a × 10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2021 © UCLES 2021 Page 5 of 8 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(a)(i) 0.4 ; 1 1(a)(ii) table drawn with a minimum of two, columns / row, and a header line ; headers with units ; four correct lengths ±1 mm recorded ; 3 MP2 concentration (of sugar) / mol per dm3 or test tube / AW and length (of potato after 20 minutes) / mm MP3 A=35 B=37 C= 39 D=42 1(a)(iii) so that the results were comparable / so sugar concentration is the only variable that is changed / to ensure the surface area was the same / so surface area does not affect the rate of osmosis / AW ; 1 1(a)(iv) concentration of the sugar solution ; 1 1(a)(v) any two from: measure mass of cylinders (instead of length) ; more intermediate concentrations of sugar solution ; extend the range of concentrations used ; repeat at each concentration / replicate the investigation ; soak for longer than 20 minutes ; use warmer sugar solutions (to speed up diffusion) ; keep all at the same temperature ; dry cylinders before measuring ; 2 1(a)(vi) cut away from body / use wooden board or tile / cut on flat surface / keep blade away from body parts / dry before cutting ; 1 www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2021 © UCLES 2021 Page 6 of 8 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(b) independent variable: 1 ref. to using at least 2 different temperatures ; method: 2 method of maintaining a temperature described ; 3 use of a tissue e.g. potato / leaves / root / stem, immersed in water / sugar / salt solution ; 4 method measuring dependent variable described, i.e. length / mass / volume / surface area of (cylinders / tissue / leaves) before and after (immersion) or measuring volume of immersion liquid before and after ; 5 + 6 variables kept constant ;; max two from: • same concentration (of solution) / same volume (of solution / water) • same (initial) length / volume / mass / surface area, of potato or tissue • same type / age /variety / AW, of (potato, tissue) / same potato / same plant • same pH / use a buffer • same immersion time 7 equilibration of temperature for tissue / solution ; 8 drying before reweighing (if mass measured) ; 9 at least two repeats (of each temperature) / total of three trials ; 10 AVP ; 6 1(c)(i) iodine solution ; blue-black ; 2 www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2021 © UCLES 2021 Page 7 of 8 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(c)(ii) lines: clear, single, unbroken with no shading ; size: central cell has a minimum diameter of 56 mm ; detail one: double line (minimum) for entire cell wall ; detail two: minimum of five starch grains around perimeter of cell ; label: one starch grain labelled ; 5 1(c)(iii) (length of line AB) 10 ±1 (mm) ; 0.013 (0.011–0.014) mm ;; 3 MP1 for correct measurement MP2 for correct calculation MP3 for correct rounding to two significant figures ecf MP2 & MP3 from previous step 2(a)(i) axes: labelled with units as time (after exercise) / minutes and pulse rate / beats per minute or bpm ; scale: evenly scaled and plots occupying half of the grid in one direction ; plots: all correct ± half a small square ; line: smooth curve (through at least 4 plots) or plot points joined with ruled lines ; 4 A either orientation 2(a)(ii) any two from: pulse rate decreases as time increases / AW ; biggest decrease in pulse rate is in first, one / two, minute(s) / initially ; plateaus or levels off / returns to pre-exercise pulse rate / returns to 62 (bpm) (at 4 mins) ; 2 www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2021 © UCLES 2021 Page 8 of 8 Question Answer Marks Guidance 2(a)(iii) 60.26 (%) ;;; 3 MP1 selection of correct values from table 156 and 62 MP2 correct calculation e.g. (94 ÷ 156) × 100 = 60.2564 MP3 correct rounding to two decimal places ecf MP2 and MP3 from previous step 2(a)(iv) pulse rate ; 1 2(b) 120 bpm is an anomalous result / AW ; (idea that anomalous / AW data), should not be included in an average ; 2 2(c) similarity, max one from ; both have, a wall / layers both have, central space / lumen / AW both contain blood (cells) differences, max two from ;; artery wall is thicker / vein wall is thinner inner surface of artery more irregular / AW ora lumen AW, smaller in artery / ora vein (overall) is bigger / ora artery (overall or lumen) circular / AW, and vein irregular (in shape) / AW 3 www.dynamicpapers.com","2025-06-22","2025-06-23","2025-06-23"

Amylase is an enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of starch to form reducing sugars. A student investigated the effect of amylase on cooked rice. The student used this method: Step 1 Two small beakers were prepared; each beaker contained 20 g of cooked white rice. One beaker was labelled W and one beaker was labelled A. Step 2 Both of the beakers were put into a 40 °C water-bath. Step 3 A measuring cylinder was used to add 20 cm3 of distilled water to the rice in beaker W. Step 4 The same measuring cylinder was then used to add 20 cm3 of a 1% amylase solution to the rice in beaker A. Step 5 The beakers were left in the water-bath for 10 minutes. Step 6 One test-tube was labelled W10 and a second test-tube was labelled A10. Step 7 After 10 minutes, a glass rod was used to stir the contents of beaker W. Step 8 A clean pipette was used to remove 2 cm3 of the liquid surrounding the rice in beaker W. The 2 cm3 of liquid was put into test-tube W10. Step 9 Steps 7 and 8 were repeated with beaker A and test-tube A10. Step 10 A syringe was used to add 2 cm3 of Benedict’s solution to each of test-tubes W10 and A10. Step 11 Test-tubes W10 and A10 were put into an 80 °C water-bath for five minutes. Step 12 After five minutes, the colours of the contents of test-tubes W10 and A10 were observed. The student’s observations are shown in Fig. 1.1.

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.

They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with:  the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question  the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question  the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively:  marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate  marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do  marks are not deducted for errors  marks are not deducted for omissions  answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2022 © UCLES 2022 Page 3 of 9 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …):  The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided.  Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n.  Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n.  Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response.  Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2022 © UCLES 2022 Page 4 of 9 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a  10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme.

Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …):  The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided.  Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n.  Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n.  Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response.  Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 4 of 7 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a  10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme.

The vitamin C is transferred from the fruit and vegetables to the water by diffusion. DCPIP can be used to estimate the concentration of vitamin C. The blue DCPIP solution reacts with the vitamin C solution and becomes colourless. A student investigated the effect of cooking time on the vitamin C content of the water. Step 1 A piece of foil was wrapped around a beaker so that the base and sides of the beaker were covered. The top of the beaker was not covered. Step 2 A piece of citrus fruit was put into the beaker. Step 3 Hot water was added to the beaker so that the piece of citrus fruit was covered. Step 4 A stop‑clock was started. Step 5 1 cm3 samples of the liquid in the beaker were taken every minute for five minutes. Each sample was put into a separate test‑tube. Step 6 A 5 cm3 syringe was filled with DCPIP solution. Any air bubbles present in the syringe were removed. Step 7 One drop of the blue DCPIP solution was added to the test‑tube containing the first sample. The test‑tube was shaken for five seconds to mix the contents. The colour of the sample in the test‑tube was observed. Step 8 The student repeated step 7 until the sample remained blue. The volume of DCPIP solution remaining in the syringe was recorded. Step 9 The syringe was refilled with 5 cm3 of DCPIP solution. Step 10 Steps 7 to 9 were repeated with the rest of the samples. Fig 1.1 shows the student’s notebook, where they recorded their results and calculated values. volume of DCPIP remaining in the syringe: 1 minute = 3.6 2 minutes = 2.8 3 minutes = 2.2 4 minutes = 1.8 5 minutes = 1.6 volume of DCPIP added: 1 minute = 1.4 2 minutes = 2.2 3 minutes = 2.8 4 minutes = 3.2 5 minutes = ......

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the May/June 2024 series for most Cambridge IGCSE, Cambridge International A and AS Level and Cambridge Pre-U components, and some Cambridge O Level components. 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2024 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2024 Page 2 of 8 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptions for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with:  the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question  the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question  the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively:  marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate  marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do  marks are not deducted for errors  marks are not deducted for omissions  answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED May/June 2024 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2024 Page 3 of 8 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).

Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …):  The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided.  Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n.  Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n.  Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited.

As a result these animals lose heat to the environment, causing their body temperature to fall. An investigation was carried out to find the effect of the volume of the body on the loss of heat to the environment. The volume of the body of an animal and its temperature can be represented by hot water. Step 1 Two 250 cm3 beakers were labelled A and B. Step 2 A line was drawn on beaker A, 6 cm up from the bottom of the beaker. A line was drawn on beaker B, 3 cm up from the bottom of the beaker. Step 3 Hot water was added to both beakers up to these marks. Step 4 A thermometer was placed in the water in each beaker and a timer started. The temperature of the water was measured immediately in both beakers and recorded in a results table. The thermometers were left in the water throughout the investigation.

An enzyme, polyphenol oxidase, is also present. It catalyses a reaction which converts the polyphenols into brown‑coloured compounds. This reaction happens when the cells are damaged and exposed to oxygen in the air. polyphenols + oxygen polyphenol oxidase brown‑coloured compounds Some students investigated the effect of pH on the enzyme polyphenol oxidase in apples. The students were provided with one apple, distilled water and four solutions labelled B, C, D and E. Each solution had a different pH. Step 1 Five Petri dishes were labelled A, B, C, D and E. Step 2 20 cm3 of distilled water was added to Petri dish A. Step 3 20 cm3 of solution B was poured into the Petri dish labelled B. Step 4 Step 3 was repeated using solutions C, D and E and the Petri dishes labelled C, D and E. Step 5 Universal Indicator paper and a pH colour chart were used to find the pH of each of the solutions in the five Petri dishes. Step 6 Six slices were cut from an apple and put on to separate white tiles. The apple slices were cut to approximately the same size. Step 7 Each apple slice was chopped into small pieces and then crushed with a spatula. Step 8 One of the crushed apple slices was put into each of the solutions in Petri dishes A, B, C, D and E. A lid was put on to each of the Petri dishes and they were left for two minutes. Step 9 The crushed apple from the remaining slice was left uncovered, on the white tile and was labelled control. Step 10 The lid of Petri dish A was removed and the liquid was poured away, leaving only the crushed apple in the Petri dish. The Petri dish lid was not replaced. Step 11 Step 10 was repeated for Petri dishes B, C, D and E. Step 12 The students looked at the colour of the crushed apple slice in each Petri dish at 0 minutes, 10 minutes and 20 minutes. The students used the key shown in Table 1.1 to identify the colour intensity value for each crushed apple slice.

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.

They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2018 © UCLES 2018 Page 3 of 8 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2018 © UCLES 2018 Page 4 of 8 Mark scheme abbreviations • ;

Some students investigated the pigments present in a green leaf using chromatography. The process of chromatography separates the pigments. The more soluble the pigment the further it moves. In this experiment the pigments in a green leaf were dissolved in a solvent (S1). The solvent moved up the paper carrying the dissolved pigments different distances. Step 1 The pigments from a green leaf were transferred to a strip of chromatography paper by pressing the leaf onto the paper using the edge of a metal disc. A green line was then visible on the paper as shown in Fig. 1.1. green line 3 cm from one end chromatography paper metal disc rolling over the leaf leaf Fig. 1.1 Step 2 Solvent S1 was poured into a test-tube to a depth of 2 cm. Step 3 The strip of chromatography paper was lowered into the test-tube with the green line at the bottom so that part of the chromatography paper was in solvent S1. The green line remained above the level of solvent S1 as shown in Fig. 1.2. 2 cm chromatography paper test-tube green line solvent S1 stopper Fig. 1.2 Step 4 The free end of the chromatography paper was folded over the edge of the test-tube and a stopper was placed into the test-tube.

They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2019 © UCLES 2019 Page 3 of 7 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen).

A student investigated how the concentration of lipase affected the break-down of fat in milk. An increase in the concentration of fatty acids in the milk will change the pH of the milk. The student used a pH indicator, bromothymol blue, and observed the colour changes of the indicator in the milk and lipase solution. Table 1.1 shows the colour of bromothymol blue indicator at different pH values. Table 1.1 pH 6 7 8 colour yellow green blue (a) Step 1 Four test-tubes were labelled L1, L2, L3 and L4. Step 2 Solutions containing different concentrations of lipase enzyme were made using the volumes of 2% lipase solution and distilled water shown in Table 1.2.

Step 4 Three different substances were added to each of test-tubes M1, M2, M3 and M4: • 5 drops of bromothymol blue indicator • 2 cm3 of sodium carbonate solution • 2 cm3 of milk. The student observed that the contents of test-tubes M1, M2, M3 and M4 were all blue. Step 5 All of the test-tubes were put into a water-bath containing warm water and left for five minutes. Step 6 After five minutes test-tubes M1 and L1 were removed from the water-bath. Step 7 The contents of test-tube M1 were poured into L1 and a stop-clock started. Step 8 The colour of the bromothymol blue indicator in test-tube L1 was observed. The time taken for the bromothymol blue indicator to become yellow was recorded. If the colour had not changed to yellow in five minutes the result was recorded as >300.

However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 3 of 8 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided. • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n. • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n. • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response. • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 4 of 8 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a × 10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme. mark scheme abbreviations • ; separates marking points • / alternative responses for the same marking point • ecf error carried forward • AVP any valid point • ora or reverse argument • underline actual word given must be used by candidate (grammatical variants excepted) • ( ) the word / phrase in brackets is not required but sets the context • max indicates the maximum number of marks • Any [number] of: accept the [number] of valid responses • R reject • A accept (for answers correctly cued by the question, or guidance for examiners) • I ignore as irrelevant • AW alternative wording (where responses vary more than usual) • AVP alternative valid point • max indicates the maximum number of marks that can be given www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 5 of 8 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(a)(i) 0.5(%) ; 1 1(a)(ii) table drawn with a minimum of two columns and a header line ; column and row headings with units ; correct time recorded in seconds for each concentration ; 3 percentage concentration of lipase and time / s 25, 38, 77, >300 1(a)(iii) as the, enzyme / lipase, concentration / percentage, increases the time to change colour, decreases / is faster ; ora the higher the enzyme concentration the faster the, fat / milk, is broken down /AW ; 1 1(b)(i) control: distilled water / L4 / 0% lipase ; explanation: to show that lipase / enzyme is causing the change (of colour in the indicator / of pH) ; 2 1(b)(ii) L1 = 6 and L4 = 8 ; 1 1(b)(iii) lipase / enzyme, concentration ; 1 1(b)(iv) any two from: volume of milk ; total volume, of (enzyme) solution ; volume of sodium carbonate solution ; number of drops of, indicator / bromothymol blue, used ; 2 1(b)(v) to give enough time for the (contents of the) test-tubes to, reach the temperature of the water-bath / equilibrate AW ; 1 1(b)(vi) idea of: colour change is subjective / end-point is hard to judge ; 1 1(c) add biuret, reagent / solution (to lipase solution) ; colour change (from blue) to purple / lilac / violet / mauve ; wear gloves / safety glasses / goggles ; 3 www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 6 of 8 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(d) independent variable 1 at least three temperatures ; 2 one below 37°C, one above 37°C, and one at 37°C ; new method 3 method of maintaining temperature described ; 4 named alternative sources of fat ; 5 correct reference to emulsion test 6 correct reference to use of a different indicator, e.g. UI 7 and 8 max 2 from given method ;; • same, volume of sodium carbonate • same number of drops of indicator • same volume of milk • measure time taken for indicator to change colour • idea of equilibrate enzyme and milk before mixing / AW 9 and 10 max 2 from variables kept constant ;; • same volume of indicator • same type of milk / fat • same volume of fat ; • same amount / volume / concentration, of lipase 11 ref. to two or more repeats ; 6 www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 7 of 8 Question Answer Marks Guidance 2(a) ;;; letter on Fig. 2.2 name of flower part number visible A stigma 1 B filament 8 C sepal 4 3 one mark per row 2(b)(i) lines: clear single outer line without shading ; size: X-Y bigger than 35 mm ; rounded structures inside grain ; pollen tube top edge with one indentation ; label to pollen tube ; 5 2(b)(ii) line XY 35 ±1 (mm) ; 0.1 mm / 100 µm / 0.01 cm ;; 3 MP1 correct measurement MP2 correct calculation A ecf measurement ÷ 350 MP3 correct unit 2(c)(i) any two from: pollen germinated faster / germination rate is higher, in S1 (than S2) (at the start) / AW ; ora by 60 minutes no difference between (percentage germination) in S1 and S2 ; (pollen in) S1 stops germinating after 50 minutes / AW ; only 51% / not all pollen grains, germinated ; 2 2(c)(ii) idea that different numbers of pollen were counted on each slide ; 1 2(c)(iii) divide the number germinated by the total ; multiply by 100 ; 2 www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2020 © UCLES 2020 Page 8 of 8 Question Answer Marks Guidance 2(d) y-axis scaled correctly with suitable numbers ; plot for B and C correct and labelled ; 2 www.dynamicpapers.com","2025-06-22","2025-06-23","2025-06-23"

A student investigated the molecules that can diffuse through dialysis tubing. Step 1 A piece of dialysis tubing was soaked in water and a knot was tied at one end to form a bag. Step 2 The unknotted end of the dialysis tubing was opened and 20 cm3 of a solution, M, was put into the dialysis tubing bag. Step 3 The outside of the dialysis tubing bag was rinsed with distilled water. Step 4 The dialysis tubing bag was put inside a large test-tube and the open end of the tubing was folded over the top of the large test-tube. It was secured with an elastic band, as shown in Fig. 1.1. Step 5 The large test-tube was then filled with distilled water, as shown in Fig. 1.1. elastic band distilled water open end of the dialysis tubing folded over the top of test-tube solution M inside the dialysis tubing bag knotted end of the dialysis tubing bag Fig. 1.1 Step 6 The large test-tube was left in a test-tube rack for 15 minutes. Step 7 After 15 minutes, the dialysis tubing bag was removed from the large test-tube and the contents of the bag were emptied into a beaker labelled M. 2 cm3 samples of solution M were tested for reducing sugars, protein and starch. Step 8 The liquid remaining in the large test-tube was emptied into a beaker labelled T. 2 cm3 samples of this liquid were also tested for reducing sugars, protein and starch. www.dynamicpapers.com 3 0610/61/O/N/21 © UCLES 2021 [Turn over The student’s results are shown in Fig. 1.2. solution M: reducing sugars – orange, protein - purple, starch - blue-black liquid T: reducing sugars – orange, protein - blue, starch - brown Fig. 1.2 (i) Prepare a table to record the results shown in Fig. 1.2.

The concentration of vitamin C can be estimated in a sample of health drink by testing it with iodine solution. The test involves adding drops of iodine solution to the health drink sample until the sample remains blue-black. The greater the volume of iodine solution added, the higher the concentration of vitamin C in the health drink. The student used this method: Step 1 Label three test-tubes A, B and C. Step 2 Use a syringe to add 1 cm3 of starch suspension to each of test-tubes A, B and C. Step 3 Use a clean syringe to add 3 cm3 of health drink A to test-tube A. Step 4 Use a clean syringe to add 3 cm3 of health drink B to test-tube B. Step 5 Use a clean syringe to add 3 cm3 of health drink C to test-tube C. Step 6 Use a dropping pipette to add one drop of iodine solution to test-tube A and shake the test-tube gently to mix the contents. Step 7 Repeat step 6, counting the number of drops added, until a blue-black colour appears and stays blue-black after mixing. Step 8 Record the total number of drops of iodine solution added to test-tube A. Step 9 Repeat steps 6 to 8 with test-tubes B and C. Refill the dropping pipette with more iodine solution as necessary. Step 10 Pour the contents of test-tubes A, B and C into the waste container and rinse the test-tubes in clean water. Repeat steps 2 to 9 to obtain another set of results. Step 11 Repeat step 10 to obtain a third set of results. The student’s results are shown in Fig. 1.1. Solution A = 5 = 4 = 6 B = 17 = 19 = 15 C = 3 drops = 2 = 1 Fig. 1.1 www.dynamicpapers.com 3 0610/61/O/N/22 © UCLES 2022 [Turn over (a) (i) Prepare a table and record the results shown in Fig. 1.1.

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes. Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2022 series for most Cambridge IGCSE™, Cambridge International A and AS Level components and some Cambridge O Level components. 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2022 © UCLES 2022 Page 2 of 9 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2022 © UCLES 2022 Page 3 of 9 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided. • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n. • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n. • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response. • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2022 © UCLES 2022 Page 4 of 9 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a  10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme. Mark scheme abbreviations • ; separates marking points • / alternative responses for the same marking point • R reject the response • A accept the response • I ignore the response • ecf error carried forward • AVP any valid point • ora or reverse argument • AW alternative wording • underline actual word given must be used by candidate (grammatical variants excepted) • ( ) the word / phrase in brackets is not required but sets the context 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2022 © UCLES 2022 Page 5 of 9 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(a)(i) table drawn with minimum of two , columns / rows and with a line separating headings from the body of the table ;

Fairy penguins are small birds that live in Australasia where temperatures are much warmer. The body temperature of both species of penguin is maintained at approximately 38°C. A student investigated the rate of heat loss from a penguin with a large body compared with a penguin with a small body. They used a 250 cm3 beaker to represent the emperor penguin and a large test-tube to represent the fairy penguin. The student used this method: Step 1 Label the beaker A and the test-tube B. Step 2 Draw a line on beaker A and test-tube B 5 cm up from the bottom. Step 3 Use hot water to fill beaker A up to the 5 cm mark. Step 4 Place a thermometer in the water in beaker A. When the reading on the thermometer has stopped rising, measure the temperature of the water. Record this as the starting temperature. Leave the thermometer in the water throughout the investigation. Step 5 Start the stop-clock. Step 6 After one minute, measure and record the temperature of the water in beaker A. Step 7 Measure and record the temperature of the water in beaker A every minute for a total of five minutes. Step 8 Add hot water to test-tube B up to the 5 cm mark.

Cambridge International is publishing the mark schemes for the October/November 2023 series for most Cambridge IGCSE, Cambridge International A and AS Level components, and some Cambridge O Level components. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 2 of 9 Generic Marking Principles These general marking principles must be applied by all examiners when marking candidate answers. They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptors for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 3 of 9 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 4 of 9 Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided. • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n. • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n. • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response. • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 5 of 9 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a  10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme. Mark scheme abbreviations • ; separates marking points • / alternative responses for the same marking point • R reject the response • A accept the response • I ignore the response • ecf error carried forward • AVP any valid point • ora or reverse argument • AW alternative wording • underline actual word given must be used by candidate (grammatical variants excepted) ( ) the word / phrase in brackets is not required but sets the context www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 6 of 9 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(a)(i) 1 table drawn with at least three, columns with a line separating the headings from the body of the table ; 2 suitable headings with units for temperature (in) o C and time (in) minutes / s ; 3 six times and temperatures recorded for both A and B and correct recording of temperatures for 5 minutes ; 4 values for all results recorded to one decimal place ; 4 1(a)(ii) rate of heat loss for A = 6.4 ; rate of heat loss for B = 8.8 ; correct unit stated i.e. °C per minute ; 3 1(a)(iii) any one from: the larger the penguin, the lower the rate of heat loss ; large penguins lose heat more slowly (than small penguins) ; 1 ora throughout 1(b)(i) the size of the container / AW ; 1 1(b)(ii) any one from: starting temperature of the water ; temperature of, environment / surroundings / room ; material the containers are made from ; total time ; sampling time / measure every minute ; height of water on each container ; AVP ; 1 www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 7 of 9 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(c)(i) independent variable: 1 at least two different temperatures ; detail of method: 2 method of maintaining different temperatures ; 3 method of cutting agar cubes ; 4 enough acid to cover cubes / AW ; 5 & 6 & 7 variables kept constant – max three from: ;;; • same, size agar cubes / shape of agar (cubes) • type of agar • concentration / pH, of acid • volume of acid • type of acid / named acid • same type of indicator / named indicator dependent variable: 8 time taken for cube to become (completely) colourless or idea of after a set period of time how much of the cube has become colourless ; 9 ref. to at least two further replications / repeat investigation two more times ; 10 relevant safety precaution e.g. goggles / gloves / cut agar on a solid surface / cut away from hands / AW ; 6 1(c)(ii) (surface area) 6 ; (: volume) 1 ; 2 www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 8 of 9 Question Answer Marks Guidance 2(a) length of line CD = 100 ±1(mm) ; 167 ;; 3 MP1 correct measurement MP2 correct calculation MP3 correct rounding to three significant figures line CD of 99 mm = 165 line CD of 101 mm = 168 ecf from previous step 2(b)(i) any two from: (lizard red blood cells are) bigger ; (lizard has) no white blood cells ; (lizard red blood cells have) oval shape / AW ; (lizard red blood cells) have a nucleus / are darker in the middle / are lighter on the outside ; 2 ora if clear that human blood is described 2(b)(ii) outline is a single clear line with no shading ; size at least 41 mm in diameter ; detail 1: small lobe to the bottom right of the upper section drawn ; detail 2: thin line joining lobes on both sides ; 4 2(c)(i) (mean) mass of haemoglobin (per athlete) ; 1 2(c)(ii) axes labelled with units – i.e. number of days (after returning to low altitude) and (mean) mass of haemoglobin (per athlete) / g ; suitable linear scale and plotting area occupies at least half of the grid in both directions ; seven points plotted ± half small square ; suitable line drawn ; 4 2(c)(iii) any indication on the candidate’s graph of a reading taken ; correct reading at 17 days from candidate’s graph  half a small square ; 2 2(d)(i) the more carbohydrate in the diet, the more exercise they can do / the longer the exercise time / the slower they get exhausted ; 1 www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2023 © UCLES 2023 Page 9 of 9 Question Answer Marks Guidance 2(d)(ii) any two from: sex ; age ; mass / weight / BMI / fat to muscle ratio / height ; ref. to diet ; sport discipline / fitness / exercise regime ; medical history or (named) health conditions / illness ; lifestyle qualified (e.g. smoking / alcohol consumption / drugs) ; 2 2(e)(i) (add) Benedict’s (solution to the sample) ; heat (and observe the colour) ; 2 2(e)(ii) iodine (solution) ; 1 www.dynamicpapers.com","2025-06-22","2025-06-23","2025-06-23"

Dialysis tubing is made from a type of membrane that is partially permeable. Only small molecules such as water can pass through this membrane. The student used this method: Step 1 Label two test-tubes S and W. Step 2 Put 20 cm3 of distilled water into each of the labelled test-tubes. Step 3 Take a piece of dialysis tubing and knot it at one end to form a bag. Step 4 Put 6 cm3 of sucrose solution into the open end of the dialysis tubing bag. Step 5 Rinse the outside of the dialysis tubing bag with distilled water.

It shows the basis on which Examiners were instructed to award marks. It does not indicate the details of the discussions that took place at an Examiners’ meeting before marking began, which would have considered the acceptability of alternative answers. Mark schemes should be read in conjunction with the question paper and the Principal Examiner Report for Teachers. Cambridge International will not enter into discussions about these mark schemes.

They should be applied alongside the specific content of the mark scheme or generic level descriptions for a question. Each question paper and mark scheme will also comply with these marking principles. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 1: Marks must be awarded in line with: • the specific content of the mark scheme or the generic level descriptors for the question • the specific skills defined in the mark scheme or in the generic level descriptors for the question • the standard of response required by a candidate as exemplified by the standardisation scripts. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 2: Marks awarded are always whole marks (not half marks, or other fractions). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 3: Marks must be awarded positively: • marks are awarded for correct/valid answers, as defined in the mark scheme. However, credit is given for valid answers which go beyond the scope of the syllabus and mark scheme, referring to your Team Leader as appropriate • marks are awarded when candidates clearly demonstrate what they know and can do • marks are not deducted for errors • marks are not deducted for omissions • answers should only be judged on the quality of spelling, punctuation and grammar when these features are specifically assessed by the question as indicated by the mark scheme. The meaning, however, should be unambiguous. GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 4: Rules must be applied consistently, e.g. in situations where candidates have not followed instructions or in the application of generic level descriptors. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2024 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2024 Page 3 of 8 GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 5: Marks should be awarded using the full range of marks defined in the mark scheme for the question (however; the use of the full mark range may be limited according to the quality of the candidate responses seen). GENERIC MARKING PRINCIPLE 6: Marks awarded are based solely on the requirements as defined in the mark scheme. Marks should not be awarded with grade thresholds or grade descriptors in mind. Science-Specific Marking Principles 1 Examiners should consider the context and scientific use of any keywords when awarding marks. Although keywords may be present, marks should not be awarded if the keywords are used incorrectly. 2 The examiner should not choose between contradictory statements given in the same question part, and credit should not be awarded for any correct statement that is contradicted within the same question part. Wrong science that is irrelevant to the question should be ignored. 3 Although spellings do not have to be correct, spellings of syllabus terms must allow for clear and unambiguous separation from other syllabus terms with which they may be confused (e.g. ethane / ethene, glucagon / glycogen, refraction / reflection). 4 The error carried forward (ecf) principle should be applied, where appropriate. If an incorrect answer is subsequently used in a scientifically correct way, the candidate should be awarded these subsequent marking points. Further guidance will be included in the mark scheme where necessary and any exceptions to this general principle will be noted. 5 ‘List rule’ guidance For questions that require n responses (e.g. State two reasons …): • The response should be read as continuous prose, even when numbered answer spaces are provided. • Any response marked ignore in the mark scheme should not count towards n. • Incorrect responses should not be awarded credit but will still count towards n. • Read the entire response to check for any responses that contradict those that would otherwise be credited. Credit should not be awarded for any responses that are contradicted within the rest of the response. Where two responses contradict one another, this should be treated as a single incorrect response. • Non-contradictory responses after the first n responses may be ignored even if they include incorrect science. www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2024 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2024 Page 4 of 8 6 Calculation specific guidance Correct answers to calculations should be given full credit even if there is no working or incorrect working, unless the question states ‘show your working’. For questions in which the number of significant figures required is not stated, credit should be awarded for correct answers when rounded by the examiner to the number of significant figures given in the mark scheme. This may not apply to measured values. For answers given in standard form (e.g. a  10n) in which the convention of restricting the value of the coefficient (a) to a value between 1 and 10 is not followed, credit may still be awarded if the answer can be converted to the answer given in the mark scheme. Unless a separate mark is given for a unit, a missing or incorrect unit will normally mean that the final calculation mark is not awarded. Exceptions to this general principle will be noted in the mark scheme. 7 Guidance for chemical equations Multiples / fractions of coefficients used in chemical equations are acceptable unless stated otherwise in the mark scheme. State symbols given in an equation should be ignored unless asked for in the question or stated otherwise in the mark scheme. Mark scheme abbreviations • ; separates marking points • / alternative responses for the same marking point • R reject the response • A accept the response • I ignore the response • ecf error carried forward • AVP any valid point • ora or reverse argument • AW alternative wording • underline actual word given must be used by candidate (grammatical variants excepted) • ( ) the word / phrase in brackets is not required but sets the context www.dynamicpapers.com 0610/61 Cambridge IGCSE – Mark Scheme PUBLISHED October/November 2024 © Cambridge University Press & Assessment 2024 Page 5 of 8 Question Answer Marks Guidance 1(a)(i) table drawn with minimum of three columns and a header line ;

Cambridge IGCSE® www.dynamicpapers.com 2 0610/06/SP/20 © UCLES 2017 1 Some students investigated the activity of catalase. Catalase is an enzyme found in plant and animal tissues. It catalyses the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. The activity of this enzyme can be measured by collecting the oxygen produced. 2H2O2 → 2H2O + O2 hydrogen peroxide water oxygen The students used the apparatus shown in Fig. 1.1 to compare the activity of catalase using pieces of sweet potato of different sizes. sweet potato cube bung foam water delivery tube hydrogen peroxide solution bubbles of oxygen Fig. 1.1 Three cubes of 10 mm × 10 mm × 10 mm of sweet potato were used. Cube 1 was placed into the test-tube and 5 cm3 of hydrogen peroxide was added. The bung was quickly replaced into the top of the test-tube. The students carefully counted the number of bubbles of oxygen delivered into the water in one minute and then measured the final height of foam in the test-tube. For cube 1, they counted 12 bubbles in one minute. The height of foam is shown in Fig. 1.2. They then discarded the contents of the test-tube and rinsed it with clean water. Cube 2 was cut into two pieces of approximately the same size. Both of these pieces were placed into the test-tube and 5 cm3 of hydrogen peroxide was added as before. For cube 2, they counted 23 bubbles in one minute. The height of foam is shown in Fig. 1.2. They then discarded the contents of the test-tube and rinsed it with clean water. Cube 3 was cut into eight small pieces which were all placed into the test-tube and 5 cm3 of hydrogen peroxide was added as before. For cube 3, they counted 38 bubbles in one minute.

The student took five leaves from a tree and weighed each of them on a balance. Each of the leaves was then hung from a different piece of wire. Fans were used to blow air at different speeds over each leaf. After 12 hours, the student weighed each leaf again. The results are shown in Table 2.1.
